# DB2-array-tasks

## Lecture 6 Homework:

- make unique array of objects [{ a:1, b:2 }, { a:2, c:3 }, { a:1, b:2 }] -> [{ a:1, b:2 }, { a:2, c:3 }]
- get through array without any for/while, map, forEach, reduce, etc. functions. You can only use getting element of an array by it's index and getting array's length, self-made functions.
- Find letters in ukranian words that are written the same as English ones. 'Дерево' -> ['e', 'p', 'o']
